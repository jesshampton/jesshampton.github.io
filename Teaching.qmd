**University of Liverpool**

I am a convenor for ENGL279 Multilingualism in Society, ENGL430 Language and Globalisation and ITAL320 The Sociolinguistic of Contemporary Italy. I also contributed with workshops and seminars on Ecolinguistics and Ecocultural Identity to MA courses such as Discourse Analysis and Language and Identity.

I supervise undergraduate and postgraduate students on language attitudes, language practices in multilingual contexts, and language endangerment.
