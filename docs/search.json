I am the PDRA on Borderscapes, working alongside Prof Stefania Tufi (PI), Wendy O’Neill (RA), Emily Kearon-Warrilow (RA), our undegraduate research assistants, as well as the teachers and students at the four schools we’ve been collaborating with. https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/languages-cultures-and-film/research/projects/borderscapes/\nAs part of the project, students created their own piece of art (such as a drawing or a poem) depicting their environmental/cultural identity. These are showcased on our dedicated website created and curated by our wonderful Emily: https://borderscapes4.wixsite.com/digitalexhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEU Migrants Project\n\n\n\nSince 2019, I have been working as a Research Assistant on this timely project led by Caterina Guardamagna at the University of Liverpool. We are a small, interdisciplinary team that also includes Djordje Sredanovic from the University of Chester and Mariana Roccia from the University of Gloucestershire and the International Ecolinguistics Association.\nAs part of this ongoing project, we interviewed around 40 Italian and Spanish academics based in the North West of England, merging our dataset with Djordje’s to understand their migratory experience from a discursive perspective. Outputs include three articles (one in press at the time of writing and two ready to be submitted) and a symposium, whose proceedings are being prepared for a Special Issue and an edited volume.\nMore about our work can be found on our website https://www.eumigrants.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolentometro Project\n\n\n\nIn this project with Stefano Coretta and Simone De Cia, we are cconduting a first-of-its-kind survey of the vitality of the languages spoken in the north of Italy.\nhttps://www.soscisurvey.de/polentometro/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Ecolinguistics Association\n\n\n\n\nCo-convenor\nMembership Officer\nBook Review Editor for Language & Ecology https://www.ecoling.net\n\nhttps://www.ecolinguistics-association.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Council For Languages\n\n\n\n\nRepresentative for Linguistics, Special Interest Group: Early Career Academics\n\nhttps://university-council-for-languages.org/early-career-academics/"

Since 2016, I have been working as a research assistant, and since 2022, I have been a postdoctoral research associate. My work focuses on addressing the climate crisis by promoting new stories-to-live-by and using my academic platform to amplify the voices of marginalised communities.\nI thrive in interdisciplinary contexts where I aim to share my passion for linguistics while learning and opening my mind to other perspectives through knowledge exchange. This applies to both theory and methods. My expertise lies in qualitative methods, which more recently include co-creation and creative methods, but I strive for holistic approaches that combine qualitative methods with quantitative ones.\nI am deeply committed to the social cause of language endangerment and advocate for environmental justice through this lens. As a proud first-generation scholar, I am passionate about equality and driven by a desire to contribute to a better world for all living beings.\nMy first monograph Ecolinguistics and Endangered Languages. Emplacing ecological wisdom through language revitalisation is due in 2027. These are some of the comments received from reviewers:\n“This is a book that could advance understanding about some of the ways in which language frames and influences our attitudes to and behaviours towards environments. It employs cultural artifacts to demonstrate some of the ways in which ecological knowledge is grounded in one’s local connection to land and the cultural identity associated with that connection. Based on my own curiosity about the proposed chapters, the proposal looks worthy of pursuing for publication. Additionally, it offers a unique contribution in the integration of “cultural artifacts—recipes, art, and poems” to complement the scholarly and theoretical framings detailing examples of language endangerment and how that can affect climate-related awareness and sustainable activities.”\n“This is a great idea, I welcome it. I think the proposal is well balanced and comprehensive, addressing more than one audience with different interests across environmental studies, literature, language (including TEFL) and linguistics itself. Both research and teaching aspects of language loss and diversity are addressed here.”"

    "text": "What is an ecosophy?\nTo me, an ecosophy is a set of guiding principles that help me feel anchored as I navigate and evolve in my analyses. I recognise that as a researcher, I am ever-changing and constantly moving, and while my ecosophy provides a sense of stability, it too is evolving, albeit more slowly. This dynamic allows me to maintain my bearings without feeling lost in the unraveling of discourse.\nI base my understanding of ecosophy on that of Stibbe’s (2021: 78):\n“I realised that it’s essential for ecolinguists to reflect on the philosophical foundations of their criticism and establish a clear ecological philosophy (or ecosophy) to judge discourses against. Ecosophy is Arne Naess’s term to describe an explicit enumeration of values and assumptions about what matters, who matters, what facts about the world are to be assumed and what we should do (Naess 1995: 8). An ecosophy necessarily, by definition, includes consideration of not only humans but other species and the physical environment. Of course, anyone analysing texts with an ecological sensibility will have their own ecological philosophy, but I suggest that it’s important to reflect on it, make it explicit, and to develop it over time as we read more, analyse more data, and have more direct experience of the world.”\nStibbe, A. (2021). Ecolinguistics as a transdisciplinary movement and a way of life. In Allison Burkette & Tamara Warhol (eds), Crossing Borders, Making Connections: Interdisciplinarity in Linguistics, pp 71–88. Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter Mouton. https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501514371\n\n\nMy ecosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\n\nMy ecosophy can be summarized in one word compassion. Anything that fosters a sense of compassion among all living beings is something that I cherish and see as necessary to change the stories we live by. Compassion to oneself, to our loved ones and those we like less: compassion for those we do not yet know, for the birds, the plants, the tress, and the rivers – compassion for all of those with whom we share a life on this beautiful planet.\nFrom Hampton (2022), available from https://doi.org/10.1515/jwl-2022-0006"
