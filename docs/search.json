I am the PDRA on Borderscapes, working alongside Prof Stefania Tufi (PI), Wendy O’Neill (RA), Emily Kearon-Warrilow (RA), our undegraduate research assistants, as well as the teachers and students at the four schools we’ve been collaborating with. https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/languages-cultures-and-film/research/projects/borderscapes/\nAs part of the project, students created their own piece of art (such as a drawing or a poem) depicting their environmental/cultural identity. These are showcased on our dedicated website created and curated by our wonderful Emily: https://borderscapes4.wixsite.com/digitalexhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEU Migrants Project\n\n\n\nSince 2019, I have been working as a Research Assistant on this timely project led by Caterina Guardamagna at the University of Liverpool. We are a small, interdisciplinary team that also includes Djordje Sredanovic from the University of Chester and Mariana Roccia from the University of Gloucestershire and the International Ecolinguistics Association.\nAs part of this ongoing project, we interviewed around 40 Italian and Spanish academics based in the North West of England, merging our dataset with Djordje’s to understand their migratory experience from a discursive perspective. Outputs include three articles (one in press at the time of writing and two ready to be submitted) and a symposium, whose proceedings are being prepared for a Special Issue and an edited volume.\nMore about our work can be found on our website https://www.eumigrants.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolentometro Project\n\n\n\nIn this project with Stefano Coretta and Simone De Cia, we are cconduting a first-of-its-kind survey of the vitality of the languages spoken in the north of Italy.\nhttps://www.soscisurvey.de/polentometro/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Ecolinguistics Association\n\n\n\n\nCo-convenor\nMembership Officer\nBook Review Editor for Language & Ecology https://www.ecoling.net\n\nhttps://www.ecolinguistics-association.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAAL RICH SIG\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer for BAAL RICH SIG\n\nhttps://richsig.wordpress.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Council For Languages\n\n\n\n\n2022-2025 Representative for Linguistics, Special Interest Group: Early Career Academics\n\nhttps://university-council-for-languages.org/early-career-academics/"

    "text": "What is an ecosophy?\nTo me, an ecosophy is a set of guiding principles that help me feel anchored as I navigate and evolve in my analyses. I recognise that as a researcher, I am ever-changing and constantly moving, and while my ecosophy provides a sense of stability, it too is evolving, albeit more slowly. This dynamic allows me to maintain my bearings without feeling lost in the unraveling of discourse.\nI base my understanding of ecosophy on that of Stibbe’s (2021: 78):\n“I realised that it’s essential for ecolinguists to reflect on the philosophical foundations of their criticism and establish a clear ecological philosophy (or ecosophy) to judge discourses against. Ecosophy is Arne Naess’s term to describe an explicit enumeration of values and assumptions about what matters, who matters, what facts about the world are to be assumed and what we should do (Naess 1995: 8). An ecosophy necessarily, by definition, includes consideration of not only humans but other species and the physical environment. Of course, anyone analysing texts with an ecological sensibility will have their own ecological philosophy, but I suggest that it’s important to reflect on it, make it explicit, and to develop it over time as we read more, analyse more data, and have more direct experience of the world.”\nStibbe, A. (2021). Ecolinguistics as a transdisciplinary movement and a way of life. In Allison Burkette & Tamara Warhol (eds), Crossing Borders, Making Connections: Interdisciplinarity in Linguistics, pp 71–88. Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter Mouton. https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501514371\n\n\nMy ecosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\n\nMy ecosophy can be summarized in one word compassion. Anything that fosters a sense of compassion among all living beings is something that I cherish and see as necessary to change the stories we live by. Compassion to oneself, to our loved ones and those we like less: compassion for those we do not yet know, for the birds, the plants, the tress, and the rivers – compassion for all of those with whom we share a life on this beautiful planet.\nFrom Hampton (2022), available from https://doi.org/10.1515/jwl-2022-0006"

    "text": "Bayesian Regressions for the Advancement of Linguistics\n\n\n\nJuly 2025, University of Liverpool\nFunded by Methods North West, this hybrid workshop (40 in-person, 40 online, plus unlimited asynchronous access) introduces Bayesian linear regression models for language research. Designed especially for postgraduate researchers (PGRs) and early career researchers (ECRs), the workshop is open to all levels of expertise and welcomes participants from linguistics and adjacent disciplines.\nBayesian methods offer a powerful alternative to traditional statistical approaches, moving beyond p-values to promote transparency, reproducibility, and richer data interpretation—especially valuable in fields like sociolinguistics, corpus linguistics, and phonetics.\nLed by Dr. Stefano Coretta (University of Edinburgh), the workshop includes hands-on guidance, real-world applications, and tailored prep materials to suit your experience level. Whether you’re new to R or looking to deepen your stats knowledge, this workshop provides the tools to build methodological confidence and innovation.\nPreparation materials include:\n📘 Absolute beginners in R and statistics: Chapters 1–12 of R for Data Science (Open Access at https://r4ds.hadley.nz) and intRo video lectures available at https://intro-rstats.github.io\n🎥 Beginners in R but not statistics: Follow the same preparation as above\n🧑‍💻 Beginners in statistics but not R: Review the R topics in Chapters 1–12 of R for Data Science (Open Access at https://r4ds.hadley.nz)\nFor support with R installation and preliminary troubleshooting, you will need to seek assistance through your institution, such as local drop-off clinics. On the day, you can seek clarification on Piazza and during dedicated Q&A sessions.\nWe look forward to welcoming you to explore how Bayesian models can enhance your research and push the boundaries of linguistic inquiry.\nRole: Workshop Organiser and Funding applicant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngagement and Impact for Early Career Academics\n\n\n\nJune 2025, UCFL Special Interest Group Early Career Academics\nWhat is impact, and how can ECAs and PGRs in Modern Languages engage with it?
