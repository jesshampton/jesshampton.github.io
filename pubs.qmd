### Talks

-   December 2024 -- Panelist on 6 Seconds Webinar "**Educate the Language: the stories we live by**"

The words we choose deeply influence how we feel, how we connect with others, and ultimately, how we act. In this webinar, we will explore the relationship between language and emotions, reflecting on their impact on society and how they shape our present and future. We will also introduce The Stories We Live By, a free ecolinguistics course offered by the University of Gloucestershire and featured on the UNSDG Learn platform. Join us to discover how language can become a tool for transformation toward a more sustainable and conscious future. <https://events.6seconds.org/event/NTA4MQ==>
