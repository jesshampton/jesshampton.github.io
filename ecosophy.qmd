My ecosophy can be summarized in one word *compassion*. Anything that fosters a sense of compassion among all living beings is something that I cherish and see as necessary to change the stories we live by. Compassion to oneself, to our loved ones and those we like less: compassion for those we do not yet know, for the birds, the plants, the tress, and the rivers â€“ compassion for all of those with whom we share a life on this beautiful planet.
