October 2024, University of Liverpool <https://festivalofsocialscience.com/events/europeans-and-european-culture-in-the-liverpool-city-region/>

Caterina Guardamagna and I co-present a special talk featuring dramatisations by Ivan Fantasia and Pasqualina Romano. These performances represent three key patterns identified in our research on the experiences of EU academics in the UK following Brexit (a study conducted with Mariana Roccia and Djordje Sredanovic). While not exact reproductions, the enactments capture the essence of the themes in our data. The 15-minute talk is part of a public event organised by Steph Connor (doctoral candidate in Sociolinguistics at UoL) and funded by the ESRC Festival of Social Sciences.
